Statistics and Probability Practice Repository

Overview

This repository is for practicing statistics and probability concepts for Data Science and ML. It includes Jupyter Notebooks and scripts for statistical analysis, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing.

Structure

/notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks for stats experiments (e.g., hypothesis_testing.ipynb).

/scripts/: Python scripts for reusable stats functions.

/data/: Datasets (not tracked; store locally or link to sources).

/images/: Visualizations of statistical results.
